      correctAnswer: "B",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>Freud's psychosexual theory posits that the Oral stage (birth to 18 months) is focused on gratification through the mouth. Unresolved conflicts or fixation at this stage, stemming from issues with feeding or weaning, are believed to manifest in adulthood as problems related to dependency, trust, and oral behaviors like compulsive eating or smoking. Therefore, the client's symptoms strongly suggest origins in the Oral stage. The Anal stage (A) fixation relates more to control and orderliness. Phallic stage (C) fixation involves issues stemming from the Oedipus/Electra complex, impacting relationships and identity differently. The Genital stage (D) focuses on mature intimacy, but these specific dependency and compulsive behaviors are theorized to originate earlier.</p>"

      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>The Anal stage (18 months to 3 years) centers on conflicts surrounding toilet training and the development of control and autonomy. According to Freudian theory, fixation resulting from overly strict or overly permissive parenting during this time can lead to an \"anal-retentive\" personality in adulthood, characterized by traits such as extreme orderliness, rigidity, cleanliness, and control issues, matching the client's struggles. Fixation in the Oral stage (A) is associated with dependency or oral habits. Phallic stage (C) fixation relates to unresolved Oedipal/Electra conflicts impacting sexuality and authority issues. The Latency period (D) is typically associated with skill development, not this specific personality constellation.</p>"

      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>The Phallic stage (ages 3 to 6) is central to the development of gender identity and morality in Freudian theory. It involves the Oedipus and Electra complexes, where the child navigates attraction to the opposite-sex parent and rivalry with the same-sex parent. Successful resolution involves identifying with the same-sex parent, which leads to the internalization of gender roles (gender identity) and societal/parental moral standards (formation of the Superego). The Oral stage (A) deals with trust, the Anal stage (B) with control, and the Latency period (D) with skill development.</p>"

If earlier stages were navigated successfully, the individual develops mature sexual interests directed toward peers. The primary task becomes establishing loving, monogamous relationships characterized by reciprocal intimacy and finding a balance between love and work. Resolving the Oedipus/Electra complex (A) occurs in the Phallic stage. Developing bodily control (B) is the task of the Anal stage. Repressing sexual interests (C) happens during Latency.</p>"
