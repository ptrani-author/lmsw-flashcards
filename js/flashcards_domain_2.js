      correctAnswer: "C",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>The primary purpose of the biopsychosocial (BPS) framework is to provide a holistic and integrative structure for understanding a client's situation by examining the interconnected influences of biological, psychological, and social factors on their overall well-being; this comprehensive perspective is essential for effective assessment and intervention planning. While the information gathered through a BPS assessment contributes to establishing a DSM-5 diagnosis (A), diagnosis is not the framework's principal goal, which is broader understanding. Focusing solely on psychological distress (B) contradicts the BPS model's multi-dimensional approach by neglecting biological and social aspects. Similarly, prioritizing only the social support network (D) is too narrow and fails to encompass the comprehensive scope of the BPS framework, which considers a wider range of social, biological, and psychological factors.</p>"

      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>Understanding detailed substance use history falls primarily within the biological component of the BPS assessment framework. While substance use has significant psychological and social implications, this framework explicitly places the investigation of physiological aspects like dependency patterns and withdrawal symptoms, along with usage details (frequency, quantity, type), under the biological dimension because of their direct impact on the body's systems and biochemistry.
