      correctAnswer: "C",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>The core social work value of service is best exemplified by this social worker's actions. Service involves the primary mission of helping people in need and addressing social problems, with particular attention to vulnerable populations like those experiencing homelessness. The social worker's focus on meeting fundamental human needs (shelter, food) and prioritizing client welfare, even at personal cost (extra unpaid hours), directly aligns with the principles of service. While competence (A) is essential for providing effective help, the action itself highlights the commitment to aiding those in need rather than demonstrating a specific skill level. Social justice (B) involves challenging broader societal inequities, and although homelessness is certainly a social justice issue, the direct provision of aid described in the scenario is more specifically an act of service. Integrity (D), which relates to trustworthiness and ethical conduct, is hopefully present in the social worker's actions, but the core value illustrated by the purpose and focus of the action is service.</p>"

Social justice compels social workers to challenge social injustice and pursue social change, particularly on behalf of vulnerable and oppressed groups like low-income families facing discriminatory housing policies. Organizing and advocating for policy reform addresses systemic inequities, which is central to social justice. While dignity and worth of the person (A) is upheld by fair housing, the primary focus here is systemic change. Importance of human relationships (B) is involved in community organizing, but the goal itself is social justice. Competence (D) is required for advocacy, but the value driving the action is social justice.</p>"

Avoiding notification always (A) lacks transparency. Asking the client to report (C) abdicates the worker's duty.
