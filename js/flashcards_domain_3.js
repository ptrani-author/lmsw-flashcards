      correctAnswer: "B",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>The primary focus during the initial phase of social work intervention is establishing rapport and conducting initial assessments. This foundational stage involves building a trusting relationship with the client and gathering comprehensive information to understand their needs, strengths, and challenges, which is essential before moving forward. Implementing the intervention plan (A) occurs later, during the intermediary phase, only after assessment and collaborative goal-setting are complete. Evaluating the effectiveness of specific therapeutic techniques (C) is part of the ongoing monitoring during the intermediary phase and the overall review in the concluding phase, not the initial focus. Preparing the client for termination and reviewing progress (D) are key activities characteristic of the final, concluding phase of the intervention process.</p>"

This type of question directly explores the client's hopes and desired future state, providing essential information needed to collaboratively develop meaningful goals, which is a critical activity during the initial phase of intervention. Monitoring ongoing progress (A) and implementing problem-solving strategies (B) occur later in the intermediary phase, after goals have been established and interventions are underway.

      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>This is an example of a closed-ended question because it is designed to elicit a specific piece of information—a number—and can typically be answered briefly. Closed-ended questions are useful for gathering factual details or clarifying specifics. Open-ended questions (A) encourage more elaborate responses (e.g., \"Tell me about feeling overwhelmed\").

Creating a safe, non-judgmental space through active listening, empathy, and validation is crucial for developing a working alliance before any effective intervention can occur.

      correctAnswer: "C",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>A key component of motivational interviewing is strategically highlighting discrepancies between the client's current behaviors and their broader personal goals or values. This technique, often referred to as \"developing discrepancy,\" aims to enhance the client's own motivation for change by exploring their ambivalence. Motivational interviewing specifically avoids direct confrontation (A) and imposing external motivations (B). While past trauma (D) may be relevant background, the core technique focuses on current ambivalence and motivation.</p>"

      correctAnswer: "B",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>Understanding the stages of change model (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance) allows the social worker to tailor interventions appropriately to the client's current level of readiness for change. This is crucial with involuntary clients, as mismatched interventions can increase resistance. The model does not advocate forcing clients into action (A), bypassing rapport (C), or focusing only on deficits (D); rather, it promotes meeting the client where they are.</p>"

      correctAnswer: "B",
      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: B</div><p>For a client in the precontemplation stage, especially an involuntary one, the most appropriate strategy is focusing on raising awareness about the impact of their current situation or behavior. Clients in this stage are not considering change, so interventions aim to increase awareness and prompt consideration without applying pressure. Developing action plans (A) is for later stages. Direct confrontation (C) is often counterproductive. Setting maintenance goals (D) applies after change has occurred.</p>"

      answer: "<div class='section-title'>Correct Answer: C</div><p>The primary indicator of readiness for termination is the client's achievement of the mutually agreed-upon treatment goals, coupled with their demonstrated ability to apply learned coping skills and manage their lives autonomously without ongoing therapeutic support. Client reluctance (A) needs exploration but doesn't indicate readiness. Worker feelings alone (B) aren't sufficient. A recent crisis (D) usually indicates a need for continued support, not termination.</p>"

It begins early in the therapeutic process (e.g., during contracting) with transparent discussions about the goals of therapy and the criteria or conditions under which termination will occur.
